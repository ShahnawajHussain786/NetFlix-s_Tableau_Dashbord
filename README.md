##### PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
The objective of the project is to create a interactive dashboard to provides an overview of key metrics such as the number of titles available, user ratings, and the types of content being produced. It also allows users to drill down into the data to gain deeper insight.

Data is taken from Kaggle which is called Netflix_titles. The data consists of different features like show_id, type, title, director,cast,country,date_added, release_year, rating,duration,listed_in,description
##### DASHBOARD SUMMMARY:
Through dashboard I have represented the data in an engaging and visually appealing manner. The dashboard is divided into several sections, each of which provides a different perspective on the data. The main section includes a bar chart that displays the breakdown of titles by genre. Users can filter the data by country, language, and release year to get a more detailed view of the content available on Netflix in different regions.
The second section of the dashboard focuses on user ratings. Viewers can filter the data by genre, release year, and country to get a more targeted view of user feedback.
Overall, the Netflix Dashboard is a useful tool for understanding the content available on Netflix, the preferences of users, and the trends in the streaming industry. It can be used by content producers, marketers, and analysts to make informed decisions about the types of content that will be popular among viewers and to identify opportunities for growth and expansion.
